This is the starter for our hackathon project.
Current status:
1. Data screening is done. Moving onto training.
2. Done with training it's giving around 60% accuracy and trying to generalize the model to fit real world data.
3. Fine tuned model to fit real world data, trained model now giving around 80% accuracy.
