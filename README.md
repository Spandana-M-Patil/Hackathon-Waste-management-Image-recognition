This is the starter for our hackathon project.
Current status:
1. Data screening is done. Moving onto training.
2. Done with training it's giving around 60% accuracy and trying to generalize the model to fit real world data.
3. Fine-tuned the model to fit real world data, trained model now giving around 80% accuracy. 
4. Successfully integrated the trained model into the frontend using Streamlit, enabling real-time waste classification through an interactive web interface.
